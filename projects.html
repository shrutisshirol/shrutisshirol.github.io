          <details id = "pro_discrip" open><summary>January 2019 - March 2019: Superconducting Quantum Circuits</summary> Working with Dr. Rainer Dumke at <a href="http://www1.spms.ntu.edu.sg/~rdumke/research.html">Center for Quantum Technologies, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore</a>, as a research assistant on designing, fabricating and characterizing superconducting quantum circuits. Along with this, she would also be continuing her master thesis by working on studying decoherence in flux qubits made using ultracold atoms in an optical lattice.</details>
          <details id = "pro_discrip"><summary>August 2018 - December 2018: Decoherence in a macroscopic quantum superposition</summary> Worked with Dr. Sebastian Wuester, Department of Physics, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhopal as master thesis student and worked on studying decoherence in a macroscopic quantum superposition state. Decoherence in a proposed macroscopic superposition state in Bose-Einstein condensate was examined for different processes. A master equation was derived and solved numerically. A poster was also presented at the international conference held in October 2018 by Max-Planck society and IISER Bhopal on the dynamics of ultracold systems in Rydberg atoms. </details>
          <details id="pro_discrip"><summary>May 2018 - July 2018: Single-electron spin qubit in silicon quantum dot</summary> Worked with Dr. Michel Pioro-Ladriere at Institute Quantique, University of Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada as a <a href="https://www.mitacs.ca/en/programs/globalink/globalink-research-internship" target="_blank">MITACS Globalink Research Intern</a> 2018. The project was to create microwave signals with different characteristics for electron spin manipulation in the silicon quantum dot. Arbitrary waveform generators, signal generators, single sideband mixers, and I/Q mixers were used to create signals. The project ended with writing an application note to the Keysight Technologies whose components for quantum computing research were used. I also attended a conference on Women in Physics 2018, Canada.</details>  
          <details id="pro_discrip"><summary>May 2017 - July 2017: Model Checking of Quantum Protocols</summary> Worked with Dr. Arpit Sharma, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science department, at Indian Insitute of Science Education and Research Bhopal on a review report about model checking on quantum protocols. The quantum algorithms like quantum teleportation, superdense coding, quantum error correction, and quantum cryptography were studied and model checking techniques to check the dependability of these algorithms were studied and reported.  </details> 
          <details id="pro_discrip"><summary>May 2016 - July 2016: Cell membrane elasticity</summary> Worked with Dr. Pramod Pullarkat in the Biophysics Lab as a <a href="http://www.rri.res.in/visitingstudents.html">Visiting Student at Raman Research Institute, Bangalore</a> on understanding the cell membrane elasticity by studying membrane properties of giant unilamellar lipid vesicles that are a simpler model for the cell membrane. Optical tweezers were used to pull tethers from the lipid vesicles and measure the force required to do so. This data was compared to a similar experiment with more complex cell membrane so that factors contributing to the elasticity can be found. </details>
