           <p id="bio">I was born in India. I graduated as a BS-MS in Physics at Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Bhopal on 31st May, 2019. My interests have been in quantum computing research since the junior year and ever since I have constantly worked on exploring my interest. I have worked on model checking of quantum protocols, single electron spin qubits, designing control for superconducting quantum circuits and am currently studying decoherence in macroscopic superposition states. I was awarded <a href = 'http://online-inspire.gov.in/Account/INSPIREProgramme' target="_blank">INSPIRE's Scholarship for Higher Education (SHE)</a> of Rs. 60,000 per year and entitled for an additional contigency of Rs. 20,000 for 5 years from 2014 to 2019 by the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India. I also have been a part of organizing core team of Singularity, the science fest of IISER Bhopal for two consecutive years. I have led the social initiative team of IISER Bhopal, 'Prayaas', to conduct workshops for underpreviliged women, raise funds for an NGO and conducted cleanliness drives in the village. I was involved in a government scheme undertaken by IISER Bhopal to popularize quality scientific education in government schools.</p>
